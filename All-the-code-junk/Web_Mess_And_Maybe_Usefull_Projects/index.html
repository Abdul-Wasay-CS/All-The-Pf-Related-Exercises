        Hello, I am Abdul Wasay. I am a 1st semester BS SE Student, hoping to become a software engineer in the near future.
        I Started coding as a fun activity that i liked to do in matric. Since then, i have been passionate about coding and hopefully
        remain so. My plan is to first build some simple projects like small CLI games, and some simple websites.
        So yeah, This was my intro. Hope i didnt bore you to death.
        <h3>Here is the codeseeker in real life ( definitely not what one would expect to see with such username )</h3>
